# Welcome to my page!  

## Purpose.  
Here is where I'll post and link to any public projects I work on.   
Projects may range from class work, to small projects, to small sandboxes exploring various topics.  

## About me.  
My name is Vincent and I'm a University student studying Computer Science,  
I enjoy application development and exploring different kinds of programming concepts.  

## Quotes.  
"Let nothing disturb you, nothing frighten you, all things are passing, God is unchanging.   
Patience gains all; nothing is lacking to those who have God: God alone is sufficient."  
-- St. Teresa of Avila
