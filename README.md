Let nothing disturb you, nothing frighten you, all things are passing, God is unchanging.   
Patience gains all; nothing is lacking to those who have God: God alone is sufficient.  
-- St. Teresa of Avila

These things I have spoken to you, that in me you may have peace.  
In the world you shall have distress: but have confidence, I have overcome the world.  
-- John 16:33  

Him whom the heavens cannot contain, the womb of one woman bore.  
-- St. Augustine of Hippo
